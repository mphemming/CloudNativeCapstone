# Cloud Native Geospatial Capstone Project

## Project Goals

### Summary

Create a file collection summary (e.g. number of datapoints / deployments)  by applying SQL commands to any parquet data set stored in `aodn-cloud-optimised` using DuckDB. 

### Test collection

slocum_glider_delayed_qc.parquet/ -> 553 objects, ~34.2GB 

### Motivation

Using familiar tools such as xarray and pandas are slow! (crashed my computer trying to access just 2 years of data)
